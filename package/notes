**FILTERED NAVIGATION left right doesn't get reset, generally goes into meltdown! timeinfo needs to be cleared and not draw after a new query
Excessive memory usage by background
**

1) phrefresh -  purely API polling
GET A WORKING VERSION WITH THIS-  command line (if not working), more phacker lib use CAN WAIT for later & then TEST IN WIN10 VM?

Need to unravel "refactoring" and multithreading in gui - keep multithreading but avoid "refactor" to ease understanding of flow - program each action in full even if duplicates code - then deduplicate.

Could remove MT for TOD but keep for Y/M/D

Time of day queries

1) Left right keyboard & toolbar - use same code, unravel this.
2) Toolbar query 
3) begin / end of process
4) Most recent - toolbar
5, only as a result of 1) Jump over gaps 

Others

progress status bar - looks complete
SettingsDlg - user . Executable -  with file open 
control - started moving db open outside loop for speed
first in hour - partially done?

32bit background	|		147			| 2010 freeze development?

remove depencies as much as possible
need 2015 for c++14 features?

* boost -> standard library - thread c++11, don't need as much thread control with polling
datetime not in standard
chrono - not sure why this is linked 
filesystem - might be able to remove limited use of this ?
system - not sure why linked

c:\ 
boost 151 - background release 64 / release ph
*boost 157 - background debug 64 KEEP THIS and bin the rest

local
*boost 157- background libs KEEP THIS ditto

program files x86
boost 147 - ph libs

program files
147 - background release 32 - bin / 32 bit release PH
151 - nothing dependent on this!

downloads boost installer

would have to uninstall community 2013 to use 2015

other things that could be done by phacker
icons, version info
